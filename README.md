# List Implementation

## Description
Repo for a entire implementation of List library.
This project was done as designated by our professor of Estrutura de Dados BÃ¡sica 1 (EDBI) at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte([UFRN](https://ufrn.br)).


## Compilation

It is required from user to have `gcc` installed on machine, so we can compile our ***c++*** codes. We also have utilized a collection of c++ open libs, so check carefully.
If desired,  this project's whole documentation is avaiable for guidance. To generate such documentation, user needs to hava `doxygen` program installed. How to compile and generate it, is shown below:

To compile we will use a makefile, so all compilations be more dynamic and automatic.
```bash
# To compile the whole project, insert 'make':
$ make

# To compile generate doxygen documentation, insert 'make doc':
$ make doc

# To clean up all remaining trahsh data and files, such as the binary ones, insert 'make clean':
$ make clean
```

## How to execute
Now, we show how to run the program
```bash
# To execute program:
$ ./list
```

## Implementation
The whole code was made based on the std List, so the objective of this implementations is to recreate the experience that an usual client has when using the List's lib.
