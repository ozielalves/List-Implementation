# List-Implementation

## Description
Repo for a entire implementation of List library. Done as asked by my professor at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte([UFRN](www.ufrn.br)).


## How to compile
To compile we will use a makefile, so all compilations be more dynamic and automatic.
```bash
# To compile the whole project, insert 'make':
$ make

# To compile only the objects and see if class implementations were compiled well, insert 'make build':
$ make build

# To clean up all remaining trahsh data and files, such as the binary ones, insert 'make clean':
$ make clean
```

## How to execute
Now, we show how to run the program
```bash
# To execute program:
$ ./TODO

```

## Implementation
The whole code was made based on the std List, so the objective of this implementations is to recreate the experience that an usual client has when using the List's lib.


## TODO

- [ ] The list ADT
    - [ ] Constructors, Destructos and Assigment
    - [ ] Common operations to all list implementations
    - [ ] Opertor overloading - non-member funtions
- [ ] Iterators
  - [ ] Getting an Iterator
  - [ ] Iterator operations
  - [ ] List container operations that require iterators
- [ ] Implementation
  - [ ] Drive code
